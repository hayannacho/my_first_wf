# Nextflow Workflow (BIOL7210 at GATECH Spring 2025)

**Author**: Anna Cho

This repository contains a simple Nextflow DSL2 workflow developed for BIOL7210 coursework. The workflow demonstrates both **sequential** and **parallel** processing using three genomics tools: `fastp`, `spades`, and `seqkit`.

**Steps:**
1. `fastp`: Performs quality trimming on **paired-end FASTQ** files.  
2. `spades`: Assembles the cleaned reads into contigs (**sequential** step after fastp).  
3. `seqkit stats`: Generates statistics on the cleaned reads (**parallel** with spades).

### Workflow DAG

![Workflow DAG](flow.png)

This DAG diagram was generated by running:
```bash
nextflow run main.nf -profile docker -with-dag flow.png
```

---

### Test Data

Paired-end FASTQ test files are included in the `data/` directory:
```
data/mini_1.fastq  
data/mini_2.fastq
```

These were created by subsampling from the public dataset `ERR1755086` (ENA: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/ERR1755086).

### Software Requirements

- **Nextflow**: v24.10.5  
- **Docker**: v27.4.0  
- **OS**: macOS (Apple M1, arm64 architecture)  

The tools used are all containerized from **BioContainers**:
- `fastp`
- `spades`
- `seqkit`

### How to Run

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:hayannacho/my_first_wf.git
cd my_first_wf
nextflow run main.nf -profile docker
```

To generate the DAG diagram:
```bash
nextflow run main.nf -profile docker -with-dag flow.png
```

### Output Files

All output files are saved in the `results/` directory:
```
results/clean_1.fastq        # Cleaned R1 reads from fastp  
results/clean_2.fastq        # Cleaned R2 reads from fastp  
results/seqkit_stats.txt     # Read statistics from seqkit  
results/spades_output/       # Genome assembly output from spades
```
